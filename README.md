## About The Project

It offers synchronization with your TMDB account. Once logged in, you can sync your favorites, watchlist, rated movies, and more. It also integrates with a local database to keep track of your shows. You can assign various statuses to each title—such as ‘planned’, ‘watched’, or ‘dropped’—rate them, and note the dates you commenced and concluded each show.

It allows you to filter shows based on genre, release dates, and more. Detailed information on each show, including the cast, crew, and recommendations for similar titles, is also available.
